#' @description This function calculates the p-value for a 2-stage PhII single arm Fleming's design
#' A stage-wise ordering of the sample space is used:
#' Let m be the stopping stage and x the total number of responses. A trial outcome (m'; x') is at least as
#' extreme (against H0) as the observed trial outcome (m; x), if one of the 3 following conditions is met:
#' (A) m' = m and x'>=x
#' (B) m' = 1, m = 2 and x'>=a
#' (C) m' = 2, m = 1 and x <=r1
#' in other words: rejection of H0 in the first stage is more extreme
#' @param n1 total number of patients in stage1
#' @param n2 total number of patients in stage2
#' @param r1 critical value futility for the first stage
#' @param a critical value efficacy for the first stage
#' @param k overall observed responses (must be larger than r1)
#' @param p0 true success probability under H0
#' @return p-value
