\description{
The primary objective of a phase II clinical trial of a new drug or regimen is to determine whether it has sufficient biological activity
against the disease under study to warrant more extensive development. \cr
This function calculates the sample size needed in a Fleming 2-stage design which is a
two-stage design that is optimal in the sense that the expected sample size is minimized if the
regimen has low activity subject to constraints upon the size of the type 1 and type 2 errors. \cr
Two-stage designs which minimize the maximum sample size are also determined. \cr
This type of design also allows stopping for efficacy
}
\details{
if x1<=r1 --> stop futility at first stage \cr
if r1<x1<a --> proceed to second dtage \cr
if x1>=a --> stop efficacy at first stage \cr
if (x1+x2)<=r --> futility at second stage \cr
if (x1+x2)> r --> efficacy at second stage \cr
So PET.H0=P_H0(X1<=r1)+P_H0(X1>=a1)
